"""
The criteria to create closure in python are
    1. We must have nested function
    2. Nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing(outer) function
    3. Enclosing/Outer function must return nested function.

closure provides some form of data hiding.
when few methods to be implemented in a class,
closure can provide an alternative.
