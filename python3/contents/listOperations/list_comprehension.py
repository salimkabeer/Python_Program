"""
List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists.

List comprehension is generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.

However, we should avoid writing very long list comprehensions in one line to ensure that code is user-friendly.

Remember, every list comprehension can be rewritten in for loop, but every for loop canâ€™t be rewritten in the form of
list comprehension.
