"""
The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects
(objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances):

A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) 
	inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.

A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies
	into it of the objects found in the original.
