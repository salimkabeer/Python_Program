Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. 
Transactions have the following four properties −

    * Atomicity − Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.

    *  Consistency − A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.

    * Isolation − Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.

    * Durability − Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.
